#  iOS Software Engineer Test

Create an app using Swift to load data from an API and display the answer to our question:
What is the average property price?


## Instructions
* Request JSON from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rightmove/Code-Challenge-iOS/master/properties.json

* Calculate the average property price from the results

* Display the average property price on the screen

* Design have asked for the question to be in the middle of the screen and the answer to be displayed 10px underneath.

* The background of the screen should be white (rgb 255, 255, 255), the text should be berry (rgb 38, 38, 55) and size 14.


## Considerations
Remember this is a chance to demonstrate your knowledge of Swift development. This can include separation of concerns, test coverage, error handling etc. 

We would expect you to spend no more than 2 evenings on this test. If you are unable to finish in this time then comments on what you would do next will suffice.


## Submission
To submit your code, please create a private GitHub repo (itâ€™s free) and share your code repo with our GitHub user, RightmoveAppsTechTask.
